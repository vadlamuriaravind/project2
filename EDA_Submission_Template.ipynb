        "In today’s dynamic digital entertainment era, streaming platforms have become an integral part of our daily lives, with millions of users consuming online content across genres, languages, and formats. Among the major players in the global streaming market, Amazon Prime Video stands out as one of the leading platforms, offering a wide variety of movies and television shows catering to diverse audiences. This project aims to conduct a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Amazon Prime Video’s catalog to uncover valuable insights and trends related to its content diversity, viewer preferences, and production strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used in this analysis comprises two primary files — titles.csv and credits.csv — containing detailed information about more than 9,000 titles and 124,000 credits of actors and directors. The titles.csv file provides metadata about each movie or show, including features like title name, show type (Movie or TV Show), release year, age certification, runtime, genres, IMDb and TMDb ratings, and production countries. The credits.csv file lists the individuals associated with each title, including their role (Actor or Director), name, and character details. Together, these datasets provide a comprehensive view of Amazon Prime’s content library, enabling a multi-dimensional exploration of its catalog.\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of this project is to identify patterns and trends within Amazon Prime Video’s catalog that can inform business and content strategies. Key questions explored include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Are movies more dominant than TV shows on Amazon Prime Video?\n",
        "\n",
        "What are the most common genres available on the platform?\n",
        "\n",
        "How has the number of titles evolved over the years?\n",
        "\n",
        "Which actors and directors have contributed most frequently to Prime’s content?\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the relationship between IMDb and TMDb ratings, and what does it reveal about viewer perceptions?\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis process begins with data cleaning and preprocessing. Missing and inconsistent values are identified and handled appropriately, ensuring accurate and reliable results. Categorical columns such as genres and production countries are parsed into lists for easier analysis. Numeric columns like release year, runtime, and ratings are converted into appropriate formats for visualization and statistical analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "A series of data visualizations are used to uncover insights. Bar plots reveal the distribution between Movies and TV Shows, highlighting that movies make up a significant portion of Prime’s library. Line charts depicting titles by release year demonstrate a sharp growth in content availability, particularly from 2010 onwards, indicating Amazon’s increasing investment in content production. Genre analysis shows that Drama, Comedy, and Action dominate the platform, reflecting mainstream audience preferences. Correlation analysis between IMDb and TMDb scores indicates a positive relationship, suggesting consistency between the two rating systems. Actor and director participation analysis highlights the most active contributors, shedding light on frequently featured talent in Amazon’s productions.\n",

        "The business insights drawn from this EDA are valuable for multiple stakeholders:\n",

        "Marketing teams can leverage popularity insights to tailor promotional campaigns.\n",
